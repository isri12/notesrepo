# 🧠 AWS AI Practitioner Study Guide  
## **Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML**  
### **Task Statement 1.1: Explain Basic AI Concepts and Terminologies**

---

## 📘 1.1 Introduction to AI and ML

### 🔹 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
**Definition:**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence — such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, solving problems, and making decisions.

**Examples:**  
- Alexa understanding your commands (NLP)  
- Amazon’s product recommendations (ML)  
- Self-driving cars (Computer Vision + Reinforcement Learning)

---

### 🔹 What is Machine Learning (ML)?
**Definition:**  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from **data** and make predictions or decisions **without being explicitly programmed**.

**How ML works (simplified flow):**
1. Collect Data  
2. Prepare (clean) Data  
3. Choose a Model (algorithm)  
4. Train the Model (learn from data)  
5. Evaluate the Model (measure accuracy)  
6. Deploy for **inference** (make predictions)

**Examples:**  
- Predicting customer churn  
- Detecting spam emails  
- Forecasting product demand  

---

### 🔹 What is Deep Learning (DL)?
**Definition:**  
Deep Learning (DL) is a **subset of Machine Learning** that uses **artificial neural networks** with many layers (deep) to learn complex patterns from massive datasets.

**Examples:**  
- Image recognition (detecting cats vs. dogs)  
- Speech-to-text (Siri, Alexa)  
- Text generation (ChatGPT)

---

### 🔹 Neural Networks Overview
Neural networks mimic how the human brain processes information.

**Basic Structure:**
- **Input Layer:** Accepts data features (e.g., pixels, words, numbers)  
- **Hidden Layers:** Perform transformations and pattern detection  
- **Output Layer:** Produces the prediction or classification  

**Example:**

Input → [Hidden Layer 1] → [Hidden Layer 2] → Output
