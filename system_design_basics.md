# System Design Basics Study Guide

### **Summary: System Design Interview, Chapter 1: Scale from Zero to Millions of Users**

This chapter provides a roadmap for designing systems that can grow seamlessly from a small number of users to millions. It introduces fundamental concepts and strategies for scalable architecture while addressing the trade-offs and challenges at each stage.

---

### **1. Scaling Phases**
- **Single Server Setup**  
  - Start simple with a monolithic application hosted on a single server.  
  - Suitable for low traffic and early-stage applications.  
  - Challenges: Limited by server resources (CPU, memory, disk, network).

- **Database Scaling**  
  - **Vertical Scaling:** Increase server capacity (e.g., more CPU, RAM).  
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** Split data across multiple database servers (e.g., sharding, replication).

- **Read/Write Splitting:**  
  - Use a primary database for writes and replicas for reads to distribute load.

---

### **2. Horizontal Scaling with Load Balancers**
- Introduce load balancers to distribute requests across multiple servers.  
- Common techniques:
  - **Round-robin:** Simple distribution across servers.
  - **Least connections:** Send traffic to servers with the lowest load.  

---

### **3. Caching**  
- Caching significantly reduces latency and decreases database load.  
- **Types of Caching:**  
  - **CDN (Content Delivery Networks):** Cache static assets (images, CSS, JS) close to users.  
  - **Application-Level Cache:** Store frequently accessed data in-memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached).

---

### **4. Asynchronous Processing**  
- Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle high-throughput tasks asynchronously.  
- Common use cases:  
  - Sending emails.  
  - Processing user uploads.

---

### **5. Stateless and Stateful Services**  
- Design stateless services to scale easily.  
  - Store user/session data in external services (e.g., Redis for sessions).  
- Minimize dependencies between nodes for better fault tolerance.

---

### **6. Database Optimization**  
- Techniques include indexing, query optimization, and denormalization.  
- Consider NoSQL databases for flexibility and scalability.

---

### **7. Monitoring and Observability**  
- Track system performance using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.  
- Measure metrics like latency, error rates, and throughput.

---

### **8. Security and Reliability**  
- Implement SSL/TLS for secure communication.  
- Use replication and backups for data reliability.  
- Design for fault tolerance (e.g., failover strategies).

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Start simple and evolve architecture as user demand grows.  
- Prioritize scalability, reliability, and performance incrementally.  
- Understand trade-offs in cost, complexity, and resource utilization at each stage.  

This chapter emphasizes iterative growth and modular design principles, ensuring systems remain robust as they scale to millions of users.

## High-Level Example: Designing a URL Shortener Service

Let's walk through a high-level design for a URL shortener service (like bit.ly) to illustrate how these concepts come together in a real-world scenario.

### 1. Requirements
- Functional:
  - Shorten long URLs
  - Redirect users to original URL when they access the short URL
  - Custom short URLs (optional)
  - Analytics (optional)
- Non-functional:
  - High availability
  - Low latency
  - Scalable

### 2. Capacity Estimation
- Assume 100 million URLs shortened per month
- Average URL length: 100 characters
- Storage required per month: 100 million * 100 bytes â‰ˆ 10 GB
- Read:Write ratio = 100:1

### 3. System Interface
```
shortenURL(api_key, original_url, custom_alias=None)
getOriginalURL(short_url)
```

### 4. Database Design
- We need to store billions of records
- Each object is small (less than 1K)
- No relationships between records
- Read-heavy workload

Consider using a NoSQL database like Cassandra:
- Key: Short URL
- Value: Original URL, User ID, Creation Date, Expiration Date

### 5. High-Level Design
```
[Client] <-> [Load Balancer] <-> [Application Servers] <-> [Database]
                                         ^
                                         |
                                    [Cache Layer]
```

### 6. Detailed Component Design
- **Hash Function**: To generate short URLs
- **URL Encoding**: Base62 encoding to generate short strings
- **Collision Resolution**: Handle cases where the same short URL is generated

### 7. Scalability and Performance
- **Database Sharding**: Partition data based on the first few characters of the short URL
- **Caching**: Use a distributed cache like Redis to store frequently accessed URLs
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming requests across multiple application servers

### 8. Security and Rate Limiting
- Use API keys for authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 9. Analytics (Optional)
- Count clicks
- Track user locations, devices, etc.

This high-level design incorporates many of the concepts from the study list, such as scalability, database design, caching, load balancing, and API design. It provides a starting point for more detailed discussions on each component and how they interact.

## Study Tips
1. Understand each concept in the study list thoroughly
2. Practice designing systems on paper or whiteboard
3. Analyze existing systems and how they might be designed
4. Stay updated with current technologies and best practices
5. Participate in system design discussions or mock interviews
6. Read case studies of large-scale systems from tech companies
7. Implement small-scale versions of system components to understand them better

Remember, system design is as much an art as it is a science. There's often no single correct answer, but rather trade-offs between different approaches based on specific requirements and constraints.

- Categorize news articles
- Allow users to browse news by category
- Provide personalized news feeds for users
- Allow users to search for specific news articles
- Provide a mobile app and web interface

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Low latency (page load time < 2 seconds)
- Scalability to handle millions of users
- Real-time news updates

## 2. Capacity Estimation and Constraints

Assumptions:
- 10 million daily active users
- Each user reads 20 articles per day
- 100,000 new articles added daily
- Average article size: 200 KB

Daily estimations:
- Read operations: 10 million * 20 = 200 million
- Write operations: 100,000 new articles
- Storage required: 100,000 * 200 KB = 20 GB/day
- Bandwidth: (200 million * 200 KB) + (100,000 * 200 KB) = 40 TB/day

## 3. System APIs

```python
def fetch_news(user_id, category=None, page_number=1, page_size=20):
    """Fetches news articles for a user"""

def search_news(user_id, query, page_number=1, page_size=20):
    """Searches for news articles based on a query"""

def update_user_preferences(user_id, preferences):
    """Updates user preferences for personalized news feed"""
```

## 4. Database Design

We'll use a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases:

### SQL Database (PostgreSQL):
- Users table: user_id, name, email, preferences
- Categories table: category_id, name

### NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
- Articles collection:
  ```json
  {
    "article_id": "unique_id",
    "title": "Article title",
    "content": "Article content",
    "source": "News source",
    "publish_date": "2023-05-20T10:30:00Z",
    "categories": ["Technology", "AI"],
    "url": "https://original-article-url.com"
  }
  ```

## 5. High-Level System Design

```
