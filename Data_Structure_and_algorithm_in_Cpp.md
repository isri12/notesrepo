### Big O - Upper Bound (Worst Case)
- Big O, also known as Big O notation, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity. It uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.
- What it means: Big O (O) describes the worst-case scenario for an algorithm.
- In simple terms: It tells you the slowest an algorithm can run in the worst
circumstances.

These are the three major asymptotic notation symbols used to describe the time complexity of algorithms:
1. **Omega (Ω)**:
   - **Meaning**: Omega (Ω) describes the best-case scenario for an algorithm. It represents the lower bound of the time complexity.
   - **Simple Explanation**: It tells you the fastest an algorithm can run in the best circumstances.

2. **Theta (Θ)**:
   - **Meaning**: Theta (Θ) represents the tight bound of the time complexity. It indicates the average or expected performance of the algorithm.
   - **Simple Explanation**: It tells you what to generally expect in terms of time complexity.

3. **Big O (O)**:
   - **Meaning**: Big O (O) describes the worst-case scenario for an algorithm. It represents the upper bound of the time complexity.
   - **Simple Explanation**: It tells you the slowest an algorithm can run in the worst circumstances.

In summary:
- Omega (Ω) gives the best-case scenario.
- Theta (Θ) provides a tight, average-case scenario.
- Big O (O) gives the worst-case scenario.

These are the basic concepts of Big O notation along with their meanings and examples:

1. **O(1)**: Constant Time
   - **Meaning**: The time complexity is constant and doesn't depend on the size of the data set.
   - **Example**: Accessing an array element by its index.

2. **O(log n)**: Logarithmic Time
   - **Meaning**: The time complexity grows logarithmically as the size of the data set increases. Each step divides the data set in half (divide and conquer).
   - **Example**: Binary search.

3. **O(n)**: Linear Time
   - **Meaning**: The time complexity grows directly proportional to the size of the data set.
   - **Example**: Looping through an array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void printArray(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Iterate through the array and print each element
    for (int num : arr) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Call the function to print the array
    printArray(numbers);

    return 0;
}
```


4. **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic Time
   - **Meaning**: The time complexity grows logarithmically with the data set size, but also performs an additional linear operation within each step.
   - **Example**: Merge sort, quick sort.

5. **O(n^2)**: Polynomial Time
   - **Meaning**: The time complexity grows quadratically with the size of the data set. Typically involves nested loops where each loop iterates over the data set.
   - **Example**: Bubble sort (O(n^2)).

Understanding these Big O concepts helps in analyzing the efficiency and scalability of algorithms and choosing the most suitable algorithm for a given problem based on its time complexity.
