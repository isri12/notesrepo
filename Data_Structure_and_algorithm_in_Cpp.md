### Big O
Big O, also known as Big O notation, represents an algorithm's worst-case complexity. It uses algebraic terms to describe the complexity of an algorithm.


Big O Basic Concepts:
• O(1): Constant Time
    - Doesn't depend on the size of the data set.
    - Example: Accessing an array element by its index.
    
• O(log n): Logarithmic Time
• Splits the data in each step (divide and conquer).
• Example: Binary search.
• O(n): Linear Time
• Directly proporFonal to the data set size.
• Example: Looping through an array.
• O(n log n): Linearithmic Time
• Splits and sorts or searches data.
• Example: Merge sort, quick sort.
• O(n2
): Polynomial Time
• Nested loops for each power of n.
• Example: Bubble sort (O(n2
)).
