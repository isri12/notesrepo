## What's New in Kubernetes v1.33 (Octarine) - Key Features
While writing this notes , the last Kubernetes version is 1.34.1 (released: 2025-09-09) : [check this releases page](https://kubernetes.io/releases/#release-v1-34)  

The current exam CKA is based on v1.33 of Kubernetes (codenamed "Octarine") , Kubernetes **v1.33.5** ((released: 2025-09-09 ) brings a mix of stability, new features, and important deprecations that are directly relevant for the CKA exam.
[Official Changes in Kubernetes 1.33](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md) 

As I’ve been preparing for the CKA certification, I've found a few of these features particularly useful, and I'm excited to share them with you.

| Feature                                | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling** | Allows you to adjust **CPU** and **memory** of a **running pod** without needing to restart it. Great for **stateful applications** and **long-running workloads** to reduce downtime. |
| **Sidecar Containers ** | Sidecar containers are now **stable**, ensuring they start **before** your main application container and run throughout the pod's lifecycle. Ideal for **logging**, **monitoring**, and **proxying** tasks. |
| **OCI Artifact and Image Volumes** | Allows you to mount **OCI artifacts** and **container images** as read-only volumes inside a pod. Useful for workflows like **sidecar injection** and **CLI tooling**. |
| **User Namespaces for Pods **     | Provides **security isolation** by keeping **container root users** isolated from the host system, making Kubernetes more secure, especially in multi-tenant or production environments. |
| **Job Success Policies**               | Adds flexibility to **batch workloads** by allowing you to define custom conditions for when a job is considered successful, improving workflow control. |
| **Ordered Namespace Deletion ** | Ensures a **systematic cleanup** process when deleting namespaces, making it more predictable and reducing the risk of errors in large environments. |
| **Service Account Token Configuration Enhancements** | Enhances flexibility for **multi-tenant environments**, allowing you to configure and manage **service account tokens** more dynamically. |
| **Extended Loopback Client Certificate Validity** | Extends the validity of **loopback client certificates** to **14 months**, reducing the administrative burden of frequent certificate rotations and helping maintain stability in control plane operations. |

---

### Why These Matter

Personally, I’m particularly excited about the **in-place scaling** and **user namespaces** features. These improvements make Kubernetes administration not only more efficient but also more **secure**. Whether you're dealing with production environments or scaling applications, these updates are a huge step forward. As Kubernetes evolves, it continues to be a powerful tool for handling complex, real-world workloads with ease and security.

## 1. Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration (25%)

This section tests your ability to **build, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters** using `kubeadm` and core Kubernetes components.

### Manage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is essential for managing access to cluster resources. Here’s how to create a role and bind it to a service account:

```bash
kubectl create role cm-writer --verb=create --resource=configmaps -n dev
kubectl create rolebinding writer-bind --role=cm-writer --serviceaccount=dev:app-sa -n dev
kubectl auth can-i create configmap --as system:serviceaccount:dev:app-sa -n dev
```

### Prepare Underlying Infrastructure

Before setting up Kubernetes, you must prepare your underlying infrastructure. Here’s how to configure the node and disable swap:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname control-plane-node
echo "10.0.0.2 worker-node" >> /etc/hosts
swapoff -a
```

This prepares the system to host Kubernetes components.

### Create and Manage Clusters (kubeadm)

To initialize the Kubernetes control plane and deploy a network plugin, use the following commands:

```bash
kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/calico.yaml
```

To join worker nodes:

```bash
kubeadm join <CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
```

### Manage Cluster Lifecycle

You’ll need to manage your cluster lifecycle, including upgrades. Here’s how to upgrade the cluster to **v1.33**:

```bash
kubeadm upgrade plan
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.33.1
kubelet --version
```

These commands allow you to upgrade your Kubernetes version to the latest stable release.

### Configure HA Control Plane

High availability (HA) for the control plane is essential for production environments. Here’s how to set up a highly available control plane:

```bash
kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "LOADBALANCER_DNS:6443" --upload-certs
```

To add an additional control-plane node:

```bash
kubeadm join LOADBALANCER_DNS:6443 --control-plane --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH> --certificate-key <CERT_KEY>
```

### Helm & Kustomize

Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that simplifies application deployment. Kustomize helps you manage configurations. Here’s how you can deploy **nginx** using Helm and apply custom configurations using Kustomize:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install nginx bitnami/nginx
kubectl apply -k ./my-kustomization/
```

### CNI / CSI / CRI

Container Network Interface (CNI), Container Storage Interface (CSI), and Container Runtime Interface (CRI) are crucial for network and storage management. Here’s how to verify the CNI configuration and check for available storage drivers:

```bash
crictl info
ls /etc/cni/net.d/
kubectl get csidrivers
```

These commands help you manage and troubleshoot networking and storage drivers in Kubernetes.

### CRDs & Operators

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators help extend Kubernetes capabilities. To interact with CRDs and manage an operator like **Prometheus**, use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get crds
kubectl describe crd <customresource>
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/download/v0.70.0/bundle.yaml
```

### New for v1.33 — In-Place Resize & Debugging

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces **in-place pod resizing**—allowing you to increase resources without restarting the pod. Additionally, debugging has improved with tools like `kubectl debug`:

```bash
kubectl patch pod mypod --subresource=resize --type=merge   -p '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"app","resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"1","memory":"512Mi"}}}]}}'
kubectl debug pod/mypod -it --image=busybox --target=app -- sh
```

These features make it easier to manage resources dynamically and debug issues on the fly without downtime.


## 2. Workloads & Scheduling (15%)

This domain evaluates your proficiency in defining and managing application workloads, along with controlling their deployment and scheduling within a Kubernetes cluster. Key areas include rolling updates, autoscaling, resource limits, health probes, and scheduling constraints.

---

### Understand Application Deployments and Perform Rolling Updates and Rollbacks

**Deployment**: A controller that ensures the desired number of Pods are running. It supports rolling updates (gradual replacement of Pods) and rollbacks (return to the last known good state).

**You're expected to:**
- Deploy applications using `kubectl` or YAML
- Upgrade images with zero downtime
- Rollback failed updates

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.27 --replicas=2
kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=nginx:1.28
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx
```

---

### Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to Configure Applications

- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive configuration (e.g., app modes, URLs).
- **Secret**: Stores sensitive values (e.g., passwords, tokens). Data is base64-encoded but not encrypted by default.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_MODE=prod
kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-literal=PASSWORD=1234
```

Injected into a Pod:
```yaml
env:
- name: APP_MODE
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: app-config
      key: APP_MODE
- name: PASSWORD
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: app-secret
      key: PASSWORD
```

---

### Configure Workload Autoscaling

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically increases or decreases the number of Pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. Requires `metrics-server` or an external metrics adapter.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5
kubectl get hpa
```

---

### Understand the Primitives Used to Create Robust, Self-Healing Deployments

Kubernetes uses several **probes and controllers** to make applications resilient:

- **Liveness Probe** → restarts containers if they hang or crash.
- **Readiness Probe** → ensures traffic only reaches Pods ready to serve.
- **Startup Probe** → for slow apps, prevents false liveness failures.
- **ReplicaSet** → guarantees a certain number of Pods run at all times.

**Example:**
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

Check in Deployment:
```bash
kubectl get deploy nginx -o yaml | grep probe -A 5
```

---

### Configure Pod Admission and Scheduling (limits, node affinity, tolerations)

Kubernetes schedules Pods onto nodes based on resources and constraints:

- **Requests/Limits**: Reserve minimum CPU/memory (requests) and enforce maximum usage (limits).
- **NodeSelector**: Place Pods only on nodes with specific labels.
- **Affinity/Anti-Affinity**: Fine-grained rules to group or separate Pods.
- **Taints/Tolerations**: Prevent Pods from scheduling on nodes unless explicitly tolerated.

**Example:**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"

nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd

tolerations:
- key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

---


## 3. Services & Networking (20%)

This domain focuses on the networking mechanisms in Kubernetes. You need to understand **Pod-to-Pod communication, Services, DNS, ingress traffic, the new Gateway API, and network security (NetworkPolicies).

---

### Understand Connectivity Between Pods

**Pod networking**: Each Pod in Kubernetes gets its own unique IP address. By default, Pods within a cluster can communicate with each other without the need for Network Address Translation (NAT).

You should be able to:
- Troubleshoot unreachable Pods.
- Test connectivity using tools like `ping`, `curl`, and `nslookup`.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl exec -it pod-a -- ping pod-b
kubectl exec -it pod-a -- curl http://<pod-ip>:<port>
```

---

### Define and Enforce Network Policies

**NetworkPolicy**: Controls the traffic between Pods. By default, all traffic is allowed. However, once a **NetworkPolicy** is applied, traffic is blocked unless explicitly allowed.

Network policies rely on **labels** (for Pods and Namespaces) and are enforced only when the **CNI plugin** supports them (such as Calico or Cilium).

**Example:**
```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
```

This policy allows traffic **from frontend Pods → to backend Pods**, blocking all other incoming traffic.

---

### Use ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer Service Types and Endpoints

**Service**: Services in Kubernetes provide stable networking to Pods since Pod IPs are ephemeral.

Service types:
- **ClusterIP** (default): Internal-only access within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port (port range 30000–32767).
- **LoadBalancer**: Integrates with cloud providers to provision an external Load Balancer.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
kubectl get svc
```

---

### Use the Gateway API to Manage Ingress Traffic

The **Gateway API** is the modern replacement for **Ingress**, providing more flexible routing, standardization, and portability across different implementations.

Key resources in Gateway API:
- **GatewayClass**: Defines the type of gateway (similar to `IngressClass`).
- **Gateway**: Represents a load balancer or data plane instance.
- **HTTPRoute**: Defines routing rules for HTTP traffic.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl get gatewayclasses
kubectl describe gateway <name>
```

Expect **Gateway API** tasks on the exam. Ingress is still relevant, but the Gateway API is the future.

---

### Know How to Use Ingress Controllers and Ingress Resources

**Ingress**: Routes external HTTP(S) traffic into the Kubernetes cluster based on hostnames and paths. To make use of Ingress, you must have an **Ingress Controller** deployed (such as `nginx-ingress`, HAProxy, or Traefik).

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Verify if the Ingress Controller is deployed:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

---

### Understand and Use CoreDNS

**CoreDNS**: CoreDNS is the DNS server inside Kubernetes that handles service discovery by resolving service names like `service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`.

CoreDNS is configurable via the `Corefile` in the `coredns` ConfigMap.

**Example:**
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
kubectl -n kube-system get configmap coredns -o yaml
```

---
## 4. Storage (10%)

This section evaluates your knowledge of **persistent storage** in Kubernetes. Unlike temporary storage (like `emptyDir` which disappears when the Pod dies), **persistent storage** ensures that data survives Pod restarts or rescheduling.

In Kubernetes, storage is managed through **Persistent Volumes (PVs)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**, typically provisioned dynamically via **StorageClasses**.

---

### Implement Storage Classes and Dynamic Volume Provisioning

- **StorageClass**: This is like a *template* for Kubernetes. It defines how volumes should be created, specifying things like volume type, speed, and reclaim policies.  
- **Dynamic Provisioning**: Instead of manually creating volumes, Kubernetes can automatically provision them when a PVC requests storage.

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

Apply and check:
```bash
kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
kubectl get sc
```

In real-world clusters, **cloud providers** (AWS, GCP, Azure) or **CSI drivers** (e.g., **rook-ceph**, **longhorn**) are often used as the **provisioner**.

---

### Configure Volume Types, Access Modes, and Reclaim Policies

**Volume Types** define where the data is stored:
- `hostPath`: A path on the node's filesystem (typically used for single-node testing).
- `emptyDir`: Temporary space that disappears when the Pod is deleted.
- `nfs`, `cephfs`, `glusterfs`, CSI drivers: External shared storage backends.

**Access Modes** specify who can read or write the volume:
- `ReadWriteOnce (RWO)`: One node can read/write the volume.
- `ReadOnlyMany (ROX)`: Many nodes can read the volume.
- `ReadWriteMany (RWX)`: Many nodes can read and write the volume simultaneously.

**Reclaim Policies** determine what happens when the PVC is deleted:
- `Retain`: Keeps the data for manual cleanup.
- `Delete`: Deletes the volume automatically when the PVC is deleted.
- `Recycle`: Deprecated in v1.33 and no longer used.

**Example PV:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: demo-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

Apply and verify:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pv.yaml
kubectl get pv
```

---

### Manage Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

- **PersistentVolume (PV)**: The actual piece of storage (think of it like a disk).
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: A request for storage by a Pod. Kubernetes automatically binds a PVC to a matching PV.

**PVC Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: demo-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

**Pod using the PVC:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pvc-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/data"
      name: storage
  volumes:
  - name: storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: demo-pvc
```

Check:
```bash
kubectl get pvc
kubectl describe pod pvc-pod
```

## 5. Troubleshooting (30%)

This is the **most important section** of the CKA exam. It tests your ability to **debug and recover** a Kubernetes cluster when things go wrong. You'll need to quickly identify issues with **nodes, Pods, control plane components, networking, and logs**, all while managing time pressure.

---

### Troubleshoot Clusters and Nodes

Nodes are the physical or virtual machines that run your Pods. When a node is unhealthy, workloads can fail or become unresponsive.

- **Check cluster health:**
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

- **Put a node into maintenance mode (drain):**
```bash
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
```

- **Bring it back after maintenance:**
```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

This is how Kubernetes lets you manage node availability. When you drain a node, it stops scheduling new Pods, and once maintenance is done, you uncordon it to allow scheduling again.

---

### Troubleshoot Cluster Components

The control plane is composed of several important components:

- **etcd**: The cluster's database
- **kube-apiserver**: The API server that handles requests from kubectl and other clients
- **kube-scheduler**: Decides where Pods should run within the cluster
- **kube-controller-manager**: Ensures the cluster is in its desired state

These are often run as **static Pods** and can be found in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`.

- **Check control plane Pods:**
```bash
ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

- **Check kubelet logs (runs on every node):**
```bash
journalctl -u kubelet
```

If the **API server** is down, your `kubectl` command won’t work, and you’ll need to check logs directly on the node to diagnose the issue.

---

### Monitor Cluster and Application Resource Usage

Resource bottlenecks (such as CPU or memory pressure) often cause issues in Kubernetes clusters.

- **Use metrics-server (make sure it’s installed):**
```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
```

- **Sort by resource usage:**
```bash
kubectl top pods --sort-by=cpu
```

This will help you identify if Pods are consuming too many resources, or if nodes are overloaded.

---

### Manage and Evaluate Container Output Streams

Logs are your best tool for troubleshooting Kubernetes issues.

- **Check Pod logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>   # for multi-container Pods
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>                    # stream logs in real time
```

- **Check node process logs (e.g., kubelet logs):**
```bash
journalctl -u kubelet -f
```

Use the `-f` flag to **follow logs** in real-time as you reproduce issues, which can be incredibly helpful in identifying what went wrong.

---

### Troubleshoot Services and Networking

Networking is one of the most common failure points in Kubernetes.

- **Check Services:** Verify that your services are correctly configured:
```bash
kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc <service-name>
```

- **Test DNS resolution inside a Pod:** Make sure your Pods can resolve DNS names:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup <service-name>
```

- **Test connectivity between Pods:** If Pods can’t communicate, check connectivity using `curl` or `ping`:
```bash
kubectl exec -it <source-pod> -- curl <target-pod-ip>:<port>
```

This will help confirm whether the issue is related to DNS resolution, Pod IPs, or Service routing.

## CKA Exam Questions and Answers

This section contains **hands-on practice scenarios** that mirror the exam.  
For each, we include: **Task → Reasoning → Solution (YAML/commands) → Exam tips**.

---

### 🟦 Schedule Pod on Master Node

**Task**  
Create a Pod `pod1` in `default` using image `httpd:2.4.41-alpine`.  
- Container name: `pod1-container`  
- Pod must **only** run on a master node (do not add new labels).  
- Write to `/opt/course/2/master_schedule_reason` why Pods are not scheduled on masters by default.

**Reasoning**  
Masters are typically tainted with `NoSchedule` to protect control-plane resources. To place a Pod there:  
1) **toleration** to ignore the taint, and 2) **nodeSelector** to target the master.

**Solution**

Inspect taints/labels:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node cluster1-master1 | grep -i taint
kubectl get node cluster1-master1 --show-labels
```

Create YAML:
```bash
kubectl run pod1 --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine -o yaml --dry-run=client > pod1.yaml
```

Edit and apply:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pod1-container
    image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
  tolerations:
  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    effect: NoSchedule
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod1.yaml
kubectl get pod pod1 -o wide
echo "Master nodes are tainted to avoid scheduling regular workloads" > /opt/course/2/master_schedule_reason
```

**Exam tips**
- You need **both** toleration and nodeSelector.  
- Don’t relabel nodes; the task forbids “adding new labels”.

### 🟦 Storage with PV, PVC, Deployment

**Task**  
- PV `safari-pv`: capacity 2Gi, `ReadWriteOnce`, `hostPath: /Volumes/Data`, no storageClass.  
- PVC `safari-pvc` in `project-tiger`: request 2Gi, `ReadWriteOnce`, no storageClass.  
- Deployment `safari` in `project-tiger` running `httpd:2.4.41-alpine` mounting at `/tmp/safari-data`.

**Reasoning**  
PV is the “disk”, PVC is the “request”. If specs match, binding occurs. Deployment mounts the claim.

**Solution**

PV:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: safari-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/Volumes/Data"
```
PVC:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: safari-pvc
  namespace: project-tiger
spec:
  accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```
Deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: safari
  namespace: project-tiger
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: safari
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: safari
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: safari-pvc
      containers:
      - name: container
        image: httpd:2.4.41-alpine
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /tmp/safari-data
```

Apply & verify:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pv.yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl -n project-tiger get pv,pvc,deploy,pods -o wide
```

**Exam tips**
- If PVC stays `Pending`, check size/access modes and that storageClassName is unset on **both** PV & PVC.  
- HostPath is node-local; for exams it’s fine.

### 🟦 RBAC with ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding

**Task**  
Create ServiceAccount `processor` in `project-hamster`. Create Role/RoleBinding (both named `processor`) to allow **only** `create` on **Secrets** and **ConfigMaps** in that namespace.

**Reasoning**  
Role defines allowed verbs/resources **in namespace**; RoleBinding attaches it to the ServiceAccount.

**Solution**
```bash
kubectl -n project-hamster create sa processor
kubectl -n project-hamster create role processor   --verb=create --resource=secrets --resource=configmaps
kubectl -n project-hamster create rolebinding processor   --role=processor --serviceaccount=project-hamster:processor
```
Verify:
```bash
kubectl -n project-hamster auth can-i create secret   --as system:serviceaccount:project-hamster:processor
kubectl -n project-hamster auth can-i create configmap   --as system:serviceaccount:project-hamster:processor
kubectl -n project-hamster auth can-i delete secret   --as system:serviceaccount:project-hamster:processor
```

**Exam tips**
- Mind pluralization: **secrets**, **configmaps**.  
- Use `kubectl -n <ns> auth can-i ...` to prove it.

---

### 🟦 DaemonSet on All Nodes

**Task**  
Namespace: `project-tiger`. Create DaemonSet `ds-important` (image `httpd:2.4-alpine`), labels `id=ds-important`, `uuid=18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462`. Requests: `cpu:10m`, `memory:10Mi`. Must run on **all nodes including masters**.

**Reasoning**  
DaemonSet = one Pod per node. Need **toleration** for master taint.

**Solution**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: ds-important
  namespace: project-tiger
  labels:
    id: ds-important
    uuid: 18426a0b-5f59-4e10-923f-c0e078e82462
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: ds-important
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: ds-important
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
        effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
      - name: ds-important
        image: httpd:2.4-alpine
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 10m
            memory: 10Mi
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl -n project-tiger get ds
kubectl -n project-tiger get pods -o wide -l id=ds-important
```

**Exam tips**
- DaemonSets don’t have `replicas`.  
- Add toleration for scheduling on masters.

---

### 🟦 Deployment with Anti-Affinity or Spread Constraints

**Task**  
Namespace `project-tiger`. Create Deployment `deploy-important` with label `id=very-important`, replicas=3.  
Two containers per Pod:  
- `container1`: `nginx:1.17.6-alpine`  
- `container2`: `kubernetes/pause`  
Ensure **max one Pod per worker node**; with 2 workers, only 2 Pods run, 1 Pending.

**Reasoning**  
Use **podAntiAffinity** or **topologySpreadConstraints** to distribute Pods across nodes and **avoid co-location**.

**Solution A — podAntiAffinity**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deploy-important
  namespace: project-tiger
  labels:
    id: very-important
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: very-important
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: very-important
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: id
                operator: In
                values: ["very-important"]
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
      containers:
      - name: container1
        image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
      - name: container2
        image: kubernetes/pause
```

**Solution B — topologySpreadConstraints**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deploy-important
  namespace: project-tiger
  labels:
    id: very-important
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: very-important
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: very-important
    spec:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            id: very-important
      containers:
      - name: container1
        image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
      - name: container2
        image: kubernetes/pause
```

Verify behavior:
```bash
kubectl -n project-tiger get deploy,pods -o wide -l id=very-important
```
Expect 2/3 Pods running (one per worker), 1 Pending.

**Exam tips**
- `topologyKey` usually `kubernetes.io/hostname`.  
- If a Pod stays `Pending`, read the **Events** in `kubectl describe pod`.

### 🟦 Multi-Container Pod with Shared Volume

**Task**  
Create Pod `multi-container-playground` in `default` with three containers: `c1`, `c2`, `c3` and a shared, **non-persistent** volume.  
- `c1`: `nginx:1.17.6-alpine`, env `MY_NODE_NAME` = node name.  
- `c2`: `busybox:1.31.1`, write `date` every second to `/vol/date.log`.  
- `c3`: `busybox:1.31.1`, `tail -f /vol/date.log`.  
Confirm logs in `c3`.

**Reasoning**  
Use `emptyDir:` as in-memory/shared ephemeral storage between containers in the same Pod.

**Solution**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-playground
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: vol
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: c1
    image: nginx:1.17.6-alpine
    env:
    - name: MY_NODE_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: spec.nodeName
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vol
      mountPath: /vol
  - name: c2
    image: busybox:1.31.1
    command: ["sh","-c","while true; do date >> /vol/date.log; sleep 1; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vol
      mountPath: /vol
  - name: c3
    image: busybox:1.31.1
    command: ["sh","-c","tail -f /vol/date.log"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vol
      mountPath: /vol
```

Apply & verify:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pod multi-container-playground
kubectl exec multi-container-playground -c c1 -- env | grep MY_NODE_NAME
kubectl logs multi-container-playground -c c3 | head
```

**Exam tips**
- `emptyDir` is perfect for **sharing** within a Pod, not across Pods.  
- `fieldRef: spec.nodeName` exposes the node name.

---

### 🟦 Secrets: Mount + Env Vars

**Task**  
- Create namespace `secret`.  
- There is an existing Secret manifest at `/opt/course/19/secret1.yaml` → create it in `secret` and mount read-only at `/tmp/secret1`.  
- Create Secret `secret2` in `secret` with `user=user1`, `pass=1234`. Inject as env `APP_USER` and `APP_PASS` in a long-running `busybox:1.31.1` Pod named `secret-pod` that can run on masters (add toleration). Verify.

**Reasoning**  
Secrets can be **mounted as files** or **exposed as env vars**. Toleration allows scheduling on tainted masters.

**Solution**

Create namespace & Secret #1:
```bash
kubectl create ns secret
# edit the namespace inside the provided file if needed
sed -e 's/namespace: .*/namespace: secret/' /opt/course/19/secret1.yaml > /tmp/secret1.yaml
kubectl apply -f /tmp/secret1.yaml
```

Create Secret #2:
```bash
kubectl -n secret create secret generic secret2   --from-literal=user=user1 --from-literal=pass=1234
```

Pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-pod
  namespace: secret
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    effect: NoSchedule
  containers:
  - name: secret-pod
    image: busybox:1.31.1
    command: ["sh","-c","sleep 1d"]
    env:
    - name: APP_USER
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: secret2
          key: user
    - name: APP_PASS
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: secret2
          key: pass
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret1
      mountPath: /tmp/secret1
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: secret1
    secret:
      secretName: secret1
```

Verify:
```bash
kubectl -n secret apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl -n secret exec secret-pod -- env | grep APP_
kubectl -n secret exec secret-pod -- ls -l /tmp/secret1
```

**Exam tips**
- Mounting a Secret as a volume is read-only by default.  
- Ensure namespace matches in Secret manifests.

### 🟦 Upgrade Node and Join Cluster

**Task**  
A node (`cluster3-worker2`) is not part of the cluster and runs an older Kubernetes. Upgrade it to the **exact** version running on `cluster3-master1` and **join** it to the cluster using `kubeadm`.

**Reasoning**  
Workers must match (or be compatible with) control-plane minor version. Use `kubeadm` to join.

**Solution**

On control plane, find version & get join command:
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
# Example output:
# kubeadm join <CP_IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
```

On the target worker (`cluster3-worker2`), install matching versions (example for Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
# Make sure repos are configured per Kubernetes docs, then:
sudo apt-get update
# Pin to the version you saw on the control plane (example v1.33.0-00):
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.33.0-00 kubeadm=1.33.0-00 kubectl=1.33.0-00
sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
```

If the node was previously initialized, reset first:
```bash
sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo rm -rf ~/.kube
```

Join:
```bash
sudo <PASTE_THE_JOIN_COMMAND_FROM_MASTER>
# e.g. sudo kubeadm join <CP_IP>:6443 --token ... --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:...
```

Back on control plane:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Exam tips**
- Use the **exact** version numbers from the control plane.  
- If join fails, check `journalctl -u kubelet -f` and consider `kubeadm reset -f` then re-join.

### 🟦 NetworkPolicy with Egress Control

**Task**  
Namespace `project-snake`. Create NetworkPolicy `np-backend` to allow **only**:  
- backend-* Pods → db1-* Pods on port **1111**  
- backend-* Pods → db2-* Pods on port **2222**  
Afterwards, backend → vault on 3333 must be **blocked**. Selector uses label `app`.

**Reasoning**  
Using **egress** rules with label selectors and ports. When any NetworkPolicy selects Pods for **egress**, **all other egress is denied** unless allowed.

**Solution**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: np-backend
  namespace: project-snake
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: db1
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 1111
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: db2
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 2222
```

Test:
```bash
kubectl -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s <db1-ip>:1111
kubectl -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s <db2-ip>:2222
kubectl -n project-snake exec backend-0 -- curl -s <vault-ip>:3333
```

**Exam tips**
- Multiple **egress** items are **OR**; within each item, `to` + `ports` are **AND**.  
- Your CNI must support NetworkPolicy (Calico, Cilium, etc.).

---

### 🟦 Etcd Backup and Restore

**Task**  
- Take an etcd **snapshot** on `cluster3-master1` to `/tmp/etcd-backup.db`.  
- Create any test Pod.  
- Restore the snapshot and verify the test Pod is gone (state rolled back).

**Reasoning**  
`etcdctl snapshot save` needs certs to auth to etcd. After restore to a new data dir, point the etcd static Pod to that dir and restart control plane.

**Solution**

On control plane, save snapshot (paths may vary with your install):
```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379   --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt   --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt   --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key   snapshot save /tmp/etcd-backup.db
```

Create a test Pod:
```bash
kubectl run test --image=nginx
kubectl get pods -l run=test -w
```

Stop control plane by moving static Pod manifests out temporarily:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /root/manifests-bak
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/* /root/manifests-bak/
# wait for components to stop
```

Restore snapshot to a fresh data dir:
```bash
etcdctl snapshot restore /tmp/etcd-backup.db --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-backup
```

Point etcd manifest to the new data dir (`/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`):
```yaml
# find the hostPath volume named etcd-data and change its path:
hostPath:
  path: /var/lib/etcd-backup
  type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

Start control plane again:
```bash
sudo mv /root/manifests-bak/* /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
# wait for components to come back
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get pods -l run=test
# expected: Not found (rolled back state)
```

**Exam tips**
- Use the **server cert/key** or **apiserver-etcd-client** pair depending on your setup.  
- Be careful editing files under `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` — kubelet auto-restarts components.

## 💬 Direct Candidate Feedback: 2025 CKA Exam Insights (August Update)

> “The exam has shifted. It’s less about copying manifests and more about **troubleshooting**, **Helm**, **CRDs**, and **Gateway APIs**.”

> “I left 3 questions blank — Helm packaging, Gateway API, and cluster setup using `kubeadm`. It was tougher than expected.”

> “Gateway API and HTTPRoute threw me off — the documentation wasn’t clear. Helm was tricky too, but overall manageable.”

> “Topics I saw: **HPA**, **Ingress**, **Helm**, **ArgoCD**, **cert-manager CRDs**, **container runtimes**, and setting up **NetworkPolicies with least privilege**.”

> “The new format made me think more deeply. I had to actually solve problems — not just recognize YAML.”

> “Low-resolution VM made it hard to read docs. And some questions were significantly more complex than the mock exams.”

> “Expect **lag, tab loading delays, and broken copy-paste**. Know your `kubectl`, `vim`, and command-line tools well.”

> “Mouse movement was sluggish — keyboard navigation with `:vsplit` and `kubectl explain` helped me save time.”
